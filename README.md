Swift playground - Board game

iOS game #swift based off a popular board game.

Currently incomplete.

* iOS 9.x
* Swift
* Target: iOS (only)

My goal is to make a very simple board game for iOS and tvOS targets using simple UI

# April 2020

Going to try to finish the project

# 19 Sep 2019

Clearing out old code - Swift 5 means I have to redo a few things.  

# 30 August 2019

After taking some time to do a Masters, I've revisited this project in the hope to finally get it finished.

There are no visuals, the main focus of this sprint is to get the models and tests working.

Basic structure now exists.

# Known Issues

State machine doesn't actually handle state right now, this is for another sprint

Game doesn't do anything.
