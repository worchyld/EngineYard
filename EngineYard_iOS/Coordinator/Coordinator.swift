/*
Coordinators are a design pattern that encourages decoupling view controllers
such that they know as little as possible about how they are presented.
As such, View Controllers should never directly push/pop or present other VCs.
They should not be aware of their existence.

That is Coordinator's job.

Coordinators can be “nested” such that child coordinators encapsulate different flows
and prevent any one of them from becoming too large.

Each coordinator has an identifier to simplify logging and debugging.
Identifier is also used as key for the `childCoordinators` dictionary.

You should never use this class directly (although you can).
Make a proper subclass and add specific behavior for the given particular usage.

Note: Don't overthink this. Idea is to have fairly small number of coordinators in the app.
If you embed controllers into other VC (thus using them as simple UI components),
then keep that flow inside the given container controller.
Expose to Coordinator only those behaviors that cause push/pop/present to bubble up.
