 *Market demands handler*

 In this phase, new existing orders for marketable locomotives
 are determiened and existing orders for old and obsolete locomotives
 are cancelled.

 It consists of obtaining the current Market for:
   green, red, yellow, blue

 A. Determine how many generations exist for each locomotive color
    - A generation exists if it has dice (orders) in either existing or customer base

 B. Once generations exist, there are 4 cases:
    i. One generation exists.
       Nothing happens

    ii. Two generations exists.
        A. Starting with lower number generation (older):
        a. Transfer one of the dice (order) from customer base (sales pool) to dice pool (remove it from play)
        b. Roll all remaining dice in sales pool (customer base)
        c. Move all dice from sales pool to orders pool
        d. Mark this locomotive as old

        B. The newer generation is checked.
        a. If it does not have maximum dice (to capacity) then add 1 to the sales pool
             then re-roll all sales pool dice then move all dice back to existing orders

    iii. Three generations exists.
        a. Start with oldest locomotive.
        b. Remove all dice from customer base and existing orders
        c. This locomotive is marked as obsolote
        d. Move to next oldest, add 1 die to customer base if required
        e. Repeat this for the newest locomotive
